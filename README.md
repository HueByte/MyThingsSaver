</br>

### Logging 
By default logger is set to "Warning" level</br>
You can change it to the following:

| Log Level | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

Warning | 3 | Logs messages for abnormal or unexpected events in the application flow.
Error |	4 | Logs error messages.
Critical | 	5 | Logs failures messages that require immediate attention.

### AllowedHosts
AllowedHosts is used for host filtering to bind your app to specific hostnames</br>
By default it's `*` which means all hosts are allowed

### ConnectionStrings
Connection strings to your database, by default SQLite with connection contained in `SQLiteConnectionString` is used as your databse</br>
You can change target database in `Database` setting

Default ConnectionString schemes: 
| Name | Scheme | 
| --- | --- |
| `DatabaseConnectionString` | server=;uid=;pwd=;database=mythingssaver |
| `SQLiteConnectionString` | Data Source=

### Database

Options:
| Database | Setting name | ConnectionString used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL | mysql | `DatabaseConnectionString` |
| SQLite | sqlite | `SQLiteConnectionString` |

### Origins
Browser security prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.</br>
 This restriction is called the same-origin policy. The same-origin policy prevents a malicious site from reading sensitive data from another site

### JWT 
* `Key` property should stay generated by your Application</br>
* `Issuer` Put your domain here. Identifies principal that issued the JWT ([Json Web Token](https://jwt.io/))</br>
* `Audience` Put your domain here. Claim that identifies the recipients that the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is intended for

### Network
* `Type` determines how app behaviour. If you're using it as standalone version set it to `standalone`, if you're using nginx set it to `nginx` to successfully configure right headers forwarding
* `HttpPort` and `HttpsPort` set them to ports you want your app to run on
* `HttpsRedirection` set true if you want redirect your users to app on https ports
</br>

# `Q&A`
### How do I keep my `appsettings.json` in the same state every debug?
> Once your `appsettings.json` is generated just move it to the *backend/App* directory.</br>
> It will be automatically moved to your debug folder every build

### Is there any contact to you?
> You can message me on discord `HueByte#1388` or send email to <MyThingsSaver@gmail.com>

### Is App still developed? 
> Yes. I'm working on it in my free time :)

### What are the future plans?
> Ambitions are big, there's not a lot of time but for future features I want to add more types of "things" you can save, for example: photos, files, links and others. I also want to add plugin support so users can personalize their things saver</br>
