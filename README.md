# `Warning`
This version of README is currently outdated, working on update :)

# `üëæ My Things Saver`
Easy to use with modern design application that allows you to save your things in well designed and comfortable environment.</br>
With powerful Markdown editor you can save your notes, lists, tasks and even import tables from other software.<br>
It's still in the early stage of development but it's fully usable now with v1.0.0 release!
</br>

# `üåÄ Start`

### System

| OS | App Version | 
| --- | --- | 
| Linux 64bit | Linux64_Standalone |
| Linux-arm 32bit | Linux86-arm |
| MacOS 64bit | MacOSx64 |
| Windows 64bit | Windowsx64 | 
| Windows 32bit | Windowsx86 |

> If you have problem running the app try installing [aspnet runtime 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) for your OS

### `Windows`
1. Download [MyThingsSaver.zip](https://github.com/HueByte/MyThingsSaver/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. Unpack it
3. Locate **App.exe** in the root directory
4. Run **App.exe**
5. Type http://localhost/ in your browser

### `Linux`
1. Download [MyThingsSaver.zip](https://github.com/HueByte/MyThingsSaver/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. Unpack it
3. Locate **App.dll** or **App** file in the root directory
4. run command: `dotnet App.dll` / or run `App` file
5. Type http://localhost/ in your browser

### `MacOS`
1. Download [MyThingsSaver.zip](https://github.com/HueByte/MyThingsSaver/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
2. Unpack it
3. Locate `App` File in the root directory
4. Run `App` file
5. Type http://localhost/ in your browser
</br>

### How to access app
* Type http://localhost/ in your browser (working only on your local machine)
* Type http://YourLocalIP/ in your browser (working only in your local network)
* Type http://YourPublicIP/ in your browser (App needs to be port forwarded - [How to?](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/))

# `üë®‚Äçüíª For Development:` 
### Development requirements
* npm
* dotnet 6.x SDK

### How to run development?
   1. git clone repository 
   2. go to *MyThingsSaver/backend/App*
   3. run command: `dotnet run`
</br>

### Configure your development 
- Remember to have self signed developer certificate for local HTTPS
- Copy contents of `.env` files from examples folder (remove `example` part of file name) to `backend/App/client`
- Copy example appsettings.json to `backend/App` or use new generated one from debug folder once you run app once
- Ports are configured in `.env`, `.env.development`, `App.csproj`, `appsettings.json`

### Configure ports
`appsettings.json` file should be inside `backend/App` and `.env` file should be inside `backend/App/client`

1. Set API ports inside `appsettings.json` (`HttpPort`, `HttpsPort`)
2. Set correct Https port to `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` variable in `.env`
3. Set client app port to `PORT` variable in `.env`
4. Set correct client port to `<SpaProxyServerUrl>` tag in `App.csproj`

> `HttpsPort` must match `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` variable<br>
> `<SpaProxyServerUrl>` must match `PORT` variable

# `‚öôÔ∏è Configuration `
If you want to reset your settings just remove `appsettings.json` from app's root directory, it will generate new file with default settings and new JWT key
</br>

### Overall Network configuration 
Handled by `Network` object in `appsettings.json`

* Nginx & HTTPS</br>Example nginx configuration file is inside `examples` folder.</br>
   1. Install [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)
   2. Replace [nginx configuration file](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html) with `examples/nginx.conf`
   3. Create `.cert` folder in the nginx root folder
   4. Get SSL certificates from [GreenLock](https://greenlock.domains/) if you don't have them
   5. Move your certificate files to `.cert` folder
   6. Open and edit `appsettings.json`
   7. Change `Type` in `Network` to `nginx`
   8. If you're using example nginx config you can set `HttpsRedirection` to `false` because it's handled by nginx
   9. If you're using example nginx config you can set `UseHSTS` to `false` because HSTS is handled by nginx
   10. Set ports to different ones than 80 and 443 because nginx will be using them (example: `"HttpPort"`: `"5000"`)
   11. Set `Issuer` and `Audience` in `JWT` to your domain 
   12. Run nginx
   13. Run App

   If you want to access your application from internet (outside your local network) you need to port forward ports your nginx is configured on, you can visit this guide for that - [How do I port forward?](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/). You need to forward ports **80** and **443** if you're using example `nginx.conf` file

* Standalone</br>Currently standalone HTTPS isn't supported so running options like `UseHSTS`, `UseHttps`, `HttpsRedirection` might break your app.
</br>

### Network
* `Type` determines how app behaviour. If you're using it as standalone version set it to `standalone`, if you're using nginx set it to `nginx` to successfully configure right headers forwarding behaviour
* `HttpPort` and `HttpsPort` set them to ports you want your app to run on
* `HttpsRedirection` set true if you want redirect your users to app on https ports
* `UseHttps` Configures app to run also at `HttpsPort` 
* `UseHSTS` HTTP Strict Transport Security Protocol which enforce using HTTPS and prevents sending any communication over HTTP

#### Disclaimer
> 1. Using settings like `HttpsRedirection`, `UseHSTS` and `UseHttps` might break your app if you don't have SSL certificate and correct middleware configured (like nginx)
> 2. If you want to run your app locally with https for whatever reason you can set `UseHttps` to true but you have to have trusted localhost SSL certificate 
> 3. Server will be served on your localhost IP by default, that means if your PC has ip for example 192.168.0.100 you can access app by typing http://192.168.0.100/ on your network, or http://localhost/ on your local machine. To check your IP type: `ipconfig` on windows, `ifconfig` on linux or 
</br>

### Logging 
By default logger is set to "Warning" level</br>
You can change it to the following:

| Log Level | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
Trace | 0 | Logs messages only for tracing purposes for the developers.
Debug | 1 |Logs messages for short-term debugging purposes.
Information | 2	| Logs messages for the flow of the application.
Warning | 3 | Logs messages for abnormal or unexpected events in the application flow.
Error |	4 | Logs error messages.
Critical | 	5 | Logs failures messages that require immediate attention.

### AllowedHosts
AllowedHosts is used for host filtering to bind your app to specific hostnames</br>
By default it's `*` which means all hosts are allowed

### ConnectionStrings
Connection strings to your database, by default SQLite with connection contained in `SQLiteConnectionString` is used as your databse</br>
You can change target database in `Database` setting

Default ConnectionString schemes: 
| Name | Scheme | 
| --- | --- |
| `DatabaseConnectionString` | server=;uid=;pwd=;database=mythingssaver |
| `SQLiteConnectionString` | Data Source=

### Database
Determines which database should be used</br>
Options:
| Database | Setting name | ConnectionString used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL | mysql | `DatabaseConnectionString` |
| SQLite | sqlite | `SQLiteConnectionString` |

### Origins
Browser security prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.</br>
 This restriction is called the same-origin policy. The same-origin policy prevents a malicious site from reading sensitive data from another site

### JWT 
* `Key` property should stay generated by your Application</br>
* `Issuer` Put your domain here. Identifies principal that issued the JWT ([Json Web Token](https://jwt.io/))</br>
* `Audience` Put your domain here. Claim that identifies the recipients that the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is intended for
</br>

# `üë®‚Äçüè´ Q&A`
### Where's my save file? (SQLite)
> You can find your save file inside `save` directory in root folder. It will be called `save.sqlite`

### How do I keep my `appsettings.json` in the same state every debug?
> Once your `appsettings.json` is generated just move it to the *backend/App* directory.</br>
> It will be automatically moved to your debug folder every build

### Is there any contact to you?
> You can message me on discord `HueByte#1388` or send email to <MyThingsSaver@gmail.com>

### Is App still being developed? 
> Yes. I'm working on it in my free time :)

### What are the future plans?
> Ambitions are big, there's not a lot of time but for future features I want to add more types of "things" you can save, for example: photos, files, links and others. I also want to add plugin support so users can personalize their things saver</br>
